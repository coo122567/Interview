# Gravity Center Calculator

## Highlights
- Designed a Gravity Center Calculator with rounding and farthest-point replacement.
- Verified with RTL and Gate-Level simulations.
- Achieved a 3% Area reduction via multiplier reuse.

## Introduction
Designed a Gravity Center Calculator with rounding and farthest-point replacement in Verilog and synthesized it with Design Compiler.
Optimized the architecture(multiplier reuse) for 3% area reduction.
