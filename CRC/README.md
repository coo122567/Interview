# CRC5/8 in three clock domain 
## Introduction
- Overview: Use Verilog and Design Compiler to design 3-Clock Domain CRC-5/8 Engine from RTL to Synthesis.
- Designed 3-Clock Domain CRC-5/8 Engine using unfolding to reduce latency by XX %.
- 
- reset synchronizer
## Simulation Result
- Gate-level simulation result

- CRC with 2-unfolding
